# Settings

At _Settings &rarr; PixelgradeLT Conductor_, you'll find the settings page:

## Vendor

When requiring a package from PixelgradeLT Conductor, the default would be a package name like `pixelgradelt-conductor/genesis`.

The "Vendor" field allows this to be changed; a value of `mypremiumcode` would mean the `require` package name would be like `mypremiumcode/genesis`.
